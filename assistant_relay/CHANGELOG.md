## 5.5
Moving to a different base image to support armv7 (Raspberry Pi). 

## 5.4:
This update changes the location of the audio responses which are showed in the webinterface. This fix the issue that they get lost after en restart or update.

It is not required to do the setup again to keep using this addon, but to get the audio responses in the webinterface working you have to reinstall and reconfigure.
