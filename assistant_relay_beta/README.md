## Assistant Relay for Hassio BETA
This add-on brings Assistant Relay (by greghesp) to Hass.io. !This is the beta version!

Assistant Relay is a Node.js server that exposes the Google Assistant as a REST API.

Send Assistant Relay any query you would send the Google Assistant SDK, and get a response back.

It also supports the Google Home Broadcast command so you can send audio notifications to your Google Home devices, without interrupting music.


##### Installation

1. Install the add-on
2. Start the add-on and open it in your browser: http://[IP]:[PORT]
3. Follow the instructions in the browser.
4. You can now use Assistant Relay.

(the IP must be the IP address of your system, not the one mentioned in the log as this is the address of the container)

##### Examples
Examples of how to send commands to Assistant Relay via HA can be found here: https://github.com/Apipa169/Assistant-Relay-for-Hassio
